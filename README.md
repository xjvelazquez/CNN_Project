# CSE154-CNN

Implementation Instructions
We have provided you with a data loader, a custom PyTorch Dataset class, specifically designed for this dataset,
and a function which partitions the dataset into train, validation splits while creating PyTorch DataLoader object
for each. The latter is an iterator over the elements in each split of the dataset which you will use to retrieve
mini-batches of samples and their labels. Please familiarize yourself with the code and read the comments.
